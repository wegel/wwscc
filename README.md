Say we want to connect to a remote computer's SSH deamon that's not publicly available, but we have an existing communication channel to this computer that allows us to launch a command (or maybe this computer creates a channel on boot and automatically starts its "proxy").

Launch the *wwsconnector* somewhere publicly reachable:

`cd wwsconnector && go build && ./wwsconnector`

Obtain a Channel ID

``CHANNEL_ID=`curl http://public_wwsconnector_hostname/create` ``

On the "target" computer, the one which can reach the resource that we want to reach (the resource can be on that same computer), run *wwscat* in proxy mode:

`wwscat --proxy localhost:22 ws://public_wwsconnector_hostname/ws/proxy/$CHANNEL_ID`

On our local computer, we can do:

`ssh -C -D 1553 -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS=no" -o ProxyCommand="wwscat \"ws://public_wwsconnector_hostname/ws/tunnel/%h\"" root@$CHANNEL_ID`

And we'll be greeted by the standard SSH login prompt from the remote computer.

SSH is used as an example; you can proxy and connect to any TCP service.

You can also create a channel of type "SSH" (the default being "tunnel") where the *wwsconnector* will itself run an ssh client, bypassing the need to have an SSH client on our end. You would create the channel by specifying that you want an SSH tunnel:

``CHANNEL_ID=`curl http://public_wwsconnector_hostname/create?type=ssh` ``

You then would run the "proxy" exactly as above, and from our computer we could do:

``./wwscat "ws://public_wwsconnector_hostname/ws/tunnel/$CHANNEL_ID?username=ubuntu&rows=`tput lines`&cols=`tput cols`"``

You would then again be prompted with a password prompt, and eventually connected to the remote's shell.

This allows us to run a terminal using a web browser, since all the browser has to do is display the terminal. The SSH client runs on the wwsconnector. As an example, you can use wwswebterminal/terminal.html (and it's accompaning files). If you really want to or if you have no better place to host the web terminal, you can put the contents of *wwswebterminal* inside a *public* folder under *wwsconnector* and your connector will serve those files.
